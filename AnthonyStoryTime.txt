Destiny 2 is fun. I like playing it. It doesn't have to gain a new audience and Activision are dumb for calling Forsaken a failure.
I am glad that Bungie is breaking off from them and becoming a publishing company themselves. Mabye we won't have to deal with 
microtransaction stuff as bad anymore (not that Destiny was every really riddled with them like other games *cough cough* Call 
of Duty *cough* and EA). I couldn't play the game for like 3 - 4 months because of Swosuair not working hardly in Oklahoma Hall 
and the game requires internet. I missed out on a whole season of content which makes me sad, but I'm back and going to enjoy 
playing it agian. 
My adventure is my own.
